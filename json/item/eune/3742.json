Momentum quickly decays while under the effects of a stun, taunt, fear, silence, blind, polymorph, or immobilize effect, and slowly decays while slowed. UNIQUE Passive - Crushing Blow: Basic attacks discharge all Momentum, dealing 1 physical damage per 2 stacks. If 100 stacks are discharged, damage is doubled and the target is slowed by 75% decaying over 1 second (melee only). ''There's only one way you'll get this armor from me...'' - forgotten namesake",
